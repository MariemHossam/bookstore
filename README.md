# bookstore
As a part of a web summer training, I made a website using HTML, CSS and Java. You 
could navigate the website and search for the books you want, browse different 
book categories (English, Arabic, fiction, middle grade) and when you find what you 
like you can add it to the cart then proceed to checkout.
